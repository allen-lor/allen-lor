## 👋 Hey there, I’m Allen. 

I’m an aspiring **Network Operations Administrator** and future **Cybersecurity Professional** who loves building things, breaking things (safely), and understanding how technology and people interact. I’m currently attending WGU and studying for certifications such as the Network+, CCNA, Security+, and CISSP certifications, while building hands‑on experience through home labs.

### 🔧 What I’m Working On
- Building a **Network Segmentation & Firewall Lab**  
- Practicing **Networking Fundamentals** (CompTIA Network+ track)  
- Strengthening my skills in **Network Automation**, **Cloud Computing**, and **Infrastructure Hardening**
- Documenting my learning journey through GitHub projects and write‑ups  

### 🌱 What I’m Learning
- Systems administration  
- Networking concepts (topologies, protocols, VLANs, firewalls)  
- Cybersecurity basics and secure infrastructure design  
- How to translate technical work into clear documentation  

### 🛡️ Home Projects

#### 🕵️ [Network Traffic Analysis & Endpoint Provisioning Lab](https://github.com/allen-lor/Network-Traffic-Analysis-Endpoint-Provisioning-Lab)
**Objective:** Simulated a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack to analyze unencrypted network traffic.
* **Infrastructure:** Provisioned a Windows 10 Enterprise endpoint from ISO in VirtualBox.
* **Networking:** Engineered a bridged network adapter to bypass NAT isolation.
* **Analysis:** Intercepted cleartext credentials using Wireshark packet capture (`http.request.method == POST`).
* **Tools:** Wireshark, VirtualBox, TCP/IP, HTTP.

#### 🌐 [Enterprise-Lite Network Architecture & Segmentation Lab](https://github.com/allen-lor/Layer-3-Switched-Network-Automated-Addressing.git)
**Objective:** Simulated a corporate network environment to deploy isolated broadcast domains and automate IP address provisioning.
* **Infrastructure:** Provisioned a multi-departmental network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer.
* **Networking:** Engineered 802.1Q trunking and inter-VLAN routing to establish logical separation.
* **Implementation:** Automated dynamic IPv4 allocation via centralized DHCP pools and mitigated Layer 2 loops using STP ( `spanning-tree portfast` ).
* **Tools:** Cisco IOS, Packet Tracer, VLAN, DHCP, STP.
