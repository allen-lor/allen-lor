## 👋 Hey there, I’m Allen. 

I’m an aspiring **Systems Administrator** and future **Cybersecurity professional** who loves building things, breaking things (safely), and understanding how technology and people interact. I’m currently completing the **Google IT Support Professional Certificate** and building hands‑on experience through home labs.

### 🔧 What I’m Working On
- Building a **Windows Server + Active Directory** lab  
- Practicing **networking fundamentals** (CompTIA Network+ track)  
- Strengthening my skills in **Linux**, **virtualization**, and **IT automation**  
- Documenting my learning journey through GitHub projects and write‑ups  

### 🌱 What I’m Learning
- Systems administration fundamentals  
- Networking concepts (topologies, protocols, VLANs, firewalls)  
- Cybersecurity basics and secure infrastructure design  
- How to translate technical work into clear documentation  

### 🛡️ Home Projects

#### 🕵️ [Network Traffic Analysis & Endpoint Provisioning Lab](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/NAME_OF_YOUR_NEW_REPO)
**Objective:** Simulated a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack to analyze unencrypted network traffic.
* **Infrastructure:** Provisioned a Windows 10 Enterprise endpoint from ISO in VirtualBox.
* **Networking:** Engineered a bridged network adapter to bypass NAT isolation.
* **Analysis:** Intercepted cleartext credentials using Wireshark packet capture (`http.request.method == POST`).
* **Tools:** Wireshark, VirtualBox, TCP/IP, HTTP.
