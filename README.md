## 👋 Hey there, I’m Allen. 

I’m an aspiring **Systems Administrator** and future **Cybersecurity professional** who loves building things, breaking things (safely), and understanding how technology and people interact. I’m currently completing the **Google IT Support Professional Certificate** and building hands‑on experience through home labs.

### 🔧 What I’m Working On
- Building a **Windows Server + Active Directory** lab  
- Practicing **networking fundamentals** (CompTIA Network+ track)  
- Strengthening my skills in **Linux**, **virtualization**, and **IT automation**  
- Documenting my learning journey through GitHub projects and write‑ups  

### 🌱 What I’m Learning
- Systems administration fundamentals  
- Networking concepts (topologies, protocols, VLANs, firewalls)  
- Cybersecurity basics and secure infrastructure design  
- How to translate technical work into clear documentation  

### 🧪 Home Lab Projects
- Partitioned macOS device into a **Windows 10 lab machine**  
- VirtualBox/VMware experiments with server environments  
- Network simulations and packet analysis  
- More projects coming soon as I build out my portfolio
